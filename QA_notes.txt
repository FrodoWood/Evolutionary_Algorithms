Question 1:
What is the baseline solution described in the brief, would it be for example a generic evolutionary algorithm without any novel changes?
Answer:
The baseline solution could be for example a simple EA and then I can make a novel change for my final/variant solution. That isn't the only way to do though, the baseline solution can be totally different than the final solution but that would be more difficult to explain within the 1000 word limit since I would have to explain both baseline and final solution.

Question 2:
What is the difference between Evolutionary programming and genetic algorithm as described in the "A new evolutionary approach to cutting stock problems
with and without contiguity" paper.
Answer:
The difference is very small, essentially the difference is only in the name, as they're both EAs.


Experimental methodology
Go beyond the week 5 comparison.
Explain the difference in performance between baseline and novel algorithm instead of simply saying that A is better than B.


Search for papers on BIN PACKING to understand a better way to decode the last step going from for example {50: [30,30,25,25,20,20,20]} to activties [30,20],[30,20],[25,25], [20]
